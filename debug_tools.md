As you write software you will make mistakes alot, some times it will be easy to find a problem or bug, some times you will struggle... some times will find it easily. Relax! This is an integral part of programming... It will drive you semi insane, but it is a skill you need to master.

A bug in software development refers to a problem, if a program have a bug it means that it have an issue that stop it from working or that makes it work sub-optimally. Finding bugs in Javascript can sometimes be hard and a bit frustrating to say the least.
