Ubuntu have a utility called ```apt-get``` that allows you to easily install software. It is called a package manager, a package manager helps one to easily install software on a server or PC. Packages refers to the programs and the dependencies of the one installs on the computer.

In a termnal window on Ubuntu type ```apt-get``` and press enter.

Now lets use ```apt-get``` install some software  that we will need using the ```apt-get install <package to install>```:
