# codeX February 2015

A big welcome to Project codeX! We hope that you will enjoy this journey with us and that you will learn and apply lots of new skills in the process. Arriving at codeX you might wonder where is the class rooms? There are non! It is just you, your fellow coders and us your mentors and the BIG world wide web.

## Assumptions

This introduction assumed that you have completed both the HTML/CRedSS & Javascript courses in Codecademy, if you haven't yet it's not train smash! Just head over there and complete them before you go any further.

## Now what?

After completing all those courses in Codecademy you must be feeling quite chuffed wit yourself and you have good reason too! You put in the hours, you argued your way through the challenges and you have the badges to show. No we are going to remove the side wheels a bit, things might start feeling a bit unstable. You will be unsure what code to use where, but this is all pretty normal. Just to prove to you that you are not alone in [read this quickly](http://www.vikingcodeschool.com/posts/why-learning-to-code-is-so-damn-hard).

So now you know that you are not alone let's get going.

## Overview

### Register

So we would like you to register for a few online  that we will be using at codeX. 

Please register on there and familiarise yourself with these tools.

So quickly go and register at:
* http://www.github.com
* http://stackoverflow.com
* http://twitter.com

(Command line)[command_line.md]

## Install these software

As you already know the command line allows one to run programs to complete some tasks, one of those tasks is installing new software on your computer. Ubuntu have a utility called ```apt-get``` that allows you to install software on your laptop

Give it a go by typing ```apt-get```

If you type ```apt-get```....

Now let we install some software that we will need using the ```apt-get install command```:

* ```apt-get install git```
* ```apt-get install nodejs-legacy```
* ```apt-get install npm```

## Install these programs:

There will be a flash drive avialable so that you don't need to download these programs.

* Sublime Text
* Eclipse

## Git - Version Control

As a software developer you will be writing your code in files and you will not only be doing that on your own, but with other team members. So you will need some way of keeping track what you have done and what your team mates have done. Have you ever lost your changes in a Word document or text file, because you lots the USB Drive or because you over written some file by accident? These are the kind of things that might start to happen as you start to write code. Luckily there are a categoty of tools called Version Control tools - that allows you to manage the files that you create and change everyday as a software developer. It allows you to manage your own files, but also to share your files and changes to your files with your collegues and even other people on the internet.

The version control software we will be using is called ```git``` and to publish and share your code on ```http://github.com```. You will get to know git and github well in the next few months.

To get a quick introduction to github do the online tutorial at: https://try.github.io

Once you have a better idea of what git is all about try it on you local machine by following the instructions that are here: https://github.com/jlord/git-it

Now you should no alot more about version control using, git. Should you ever have any questions you can refer back to the resources above and the usefull guide at: http://jlord.us/git-it/ or there is always google.

## Let's code

So far most of the code you might have been written inside of Codecademy, that is a about to change. It reality most software is written in text editors or a more adanced text editors called and Integrated Development Environment or IDE for short. We will use a text editor called, Sublime Text and later you will be introduced to an IDE called Eclipse.

### Javascript on the command line

So far all the Javascript that you wrote was running inside of the web browser, by using node js, or node just for short, you can run javascript programs from the terminal, without the need for a web browser. This allows you to use Javsscript to write some programs that does not depend on the web browser such as accessing data in a database for example.
