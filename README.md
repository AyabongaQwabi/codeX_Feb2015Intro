# codeX February 2015

A big welcome to Project codeX! We hope that you will enjoy this journey with us and that you will learn and apply lots of new skills in the process. Arriving at codeX you might wonder where is the class rooms? There are non! It is just you, your fellow coders and us your mentors and the BIG world wide web.

## Assumptions

This introduction assumed that you have completed both the HTML/CSS & Javascript courses in Codecademy, if you haven't yet it's not train smash! Just head over there and complete them before you go any further.

## Now what?

After completing all those courses in Codecademy you must be feeling quite chuffed wit yourself and you have good reason too! You put in the hours, you argued your way through the challenges and you have the badges to show. No we are going to remove the side wheels a bit, things might start feeling a bit unstable. You will be unsure what code to use where, but this is all pretty normal. Just to prove to you that you are not alone in [read this quickly](http://www.vikingcodeschool.com/posts/why-learning-to-code-is-so-damn-hard).

So now you know that you are not alone let's get going.

## Overview

### Register

So we would like you to register for a few online  that we will be using at codeX. 

Please register on there and familiarise yourself with these tools.

So quickly go and register at:
* http://www.github.com
* http://stackoverflow.com
* http://twitter.com

## The command line

As a skilled software developer you need to get familiar and comfortable with the command line or terminal as it is called on Ubuntu. The terminal is the big scary black screen with a blinking cursor, waiting for you to tell it what to do. Yes initialy this is a bit scary I know. But once you get more familiar with it and master a few basic commands it will be much less scary. And over time as you learn more and more command you will realise the power of the terminal.

Let's try out the terminal window, open a terminal window and let's try out a few commands.

* type ```pwd``` then press enter - what does it do?
* type ```ls``` then press enter - what does it do?
* type ```mkdir the_terminal``` then press enter - what does it do?
* type ```ls``` then press enter - to see what you just did?
* type ```cd the_terminal``` then press enter
* now try ```pwd``` & ```ls``` again
* you can use the ```touch``` command to create a new file in the folder you created.
* to create a new fille called 'my_file.txt' type ```touch my_file.txt```
* you can now edit that file from the command line using a text editor called nano
* to edit the text file you created type ```nano my_file.txt``` in the terminal
* edit the file - add 'hello cape town' in the file and save the content of the file.
* now exit nano
* you should be back in the terminal now.

Congratulations you are now well on your way on mastering the command line.

Make a start on linuxsurvival.com, before you proceed complete the first two lessons. Complete the rest in your own time this will help you alot to master the command line.


## Install these software

As you already know the command line allows one to run programs to complete some tasks, one of those tasks is installing new software on your computer. Ubuntu have a utility called ```apt-get``` that allows you to install software on your laptop

Give it a go by typing ```apt-get```

If you type ```apt-get```....

Now let we install some software that we will need using the ```apt-get install command```:

* apt-get install git
* apt-get install nodejs-legacy
* apt-get install npm

## Download the following set of tools

* Sublime Text
* Eclipse

## Git - Version Control

As a software developer you will be writing your code in files and you will not only be doing that on your own, but with other team members. So you will need some way of keeping track what you have done and what your team mates have done. Have you ever lost your changes in a Word document or text file, because you lots the USB Drive or because you over written some file by accident? These are the kind of things that might start to happen as you start to write code. Luckily there are a categoty of tools called Version Control tools - that allows you to manage the files that you create and change everyday as a software developer. It allows you to manage your own files, but also to share your files and changes to your files with your collegues and even other people on the internet.

The version control software we will be using is called ```git``` and to publish and share your code on ```http://github.com```. You will get to know git and github well in the next few months.

To get a quick introduction to github do the online tutorial at: https://try.github.io

Now that you have a better idea of what git is all about try it on you local machine by following the instructions that are here: https://github.com/jlord/git-it

Now you should no alot more about version control using, git. Should you ever have any questions you can refer back to the resources above and the usefull guide at: http://jlord.us/git-it/

## Let's code

So far most of the code you might have been written inside of Codecademy, that is a about to change. It reality most software is wriiten in text editors or a more adanced text editors called and Integrated Development Environment or IDE for short. We will use a text editor called, Sublime Text and later you will be introduced to an IDE called Eclipse.

### Debugging

As you write software you will make mistakes alot, some times it will be easy to find a problem or bug, some times you will struggle... some times will find it easily. Relax! This is an integral part of programming... It will drive you semi insane, but it is a skill you need to master.

A bug in software development refers to a problem, if a program have a bug it means that it have an issue that stop it from working or that makes it work sub-optimally. Finding bugs in Javascript can sometimes be hard and a bit frustrating to say the least. Luckily the Chrome web browser come with some tools that goes a long way in assisting one in finding problems in ones program.

####The Chrome developer tools include:
* Developer Tools
* Javascript Console

To access them:

* click on the three lines, right of the address bar
* then click 'More tools' 
* 'Developer Tools' and 'Javascript Console' is two of the options that should be available.
* by clicking either one of them a screen will appear at the bottom of the screen in Chrome. 
 
This will allow you to do various usefull things such as:
* Identify HTML Elements by clicking in the browser
* See which CSS tags are affecting a specific element
* Switch of the CSS styling at affects the selected element
* Look at the Javascript source code used by your web page
* Add a breakpoint in Javascript sourcecode

### Sublime Text

Sublime Text editor is a text editor with lots of nice features that makes your life as a developer much easier.

A few of those features includes:
* Basic code completion - based on content in your file
* Syntax highligting
* Html tag completion
* Html file basic templates

Let's try some things:

* Create a file called index.html in Sublime text
* At the first line in the file type ```html```
* Now press 'tab'
* What happened?
* Save the file...
* Now in the body tag type ```h1```
* Press press 'tab' again
* What happened?
* In the body of the tag you just created type 'Hello World!'

### HTML

Now we are going to do some HTML outside of Codecademy
* Create a file called
* Step 1
* Step 2
* Step 3

### Javascript

Now let's add some behaviour to the web page above...


### Javascript on the command line

So far all the Javascript that you wrote was running inside of the web browser, by using node js, or node just for short, you can run javascript programs from the terminal, without the need for a web browser. This allows you to use Javsscript to write some programs that does not depend on the web browser such as accessing data in a database for example.
