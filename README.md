## Assumptions

This introduction assumed that you have completed both the HTML/CSS & Javascript courses in Codecademy, if you haven't yet it's not train smash! Just head over there and complete them before you go any further.

## Now what?

After completing all those courses in Codecademy you must be feeling quite chuffed wit yourself and you have good reason too! You put in the hours, you argued your way through the challenges and you have the badges to show. No we are going to remove the side wheels a bit, things might start feeling a bit unstable. You will be unsure what code to use where, but this is all pretty normal. Just to prove to you that you are not alone in [read this quickly](http://www.vikingcodeschool.com/posts/why-learning-to-code-is-so-damn-hard).

So now you know that you are not alone let's get going.

## Overview

Finding bugs in Javascript can sometimes be hard and a bit frustrating to say the least. Luckily the Chrome web browser come with some tools that goes a long way in assisting one in finding problems in ones program.


### Javascript on the command line

So far all the Javascript that you did was running inside of the web browser, by using node js, or node just for short you can run javascript programs from the terminal, without the need for a web browser.
