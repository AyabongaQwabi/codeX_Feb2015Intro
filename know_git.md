## Git - Version Control

As a software developer you will be writing your code in files and you will not only be doing that on your own, 
but with other team members. So you will need some way of keeping track what you have done and what your teammates 
have done. Have you ever lost your changes in a Word document or text file, because you lots the USB Drive or 
because you over written some file by accident? These are the kind of things that might start to happen as you start 
to write code. Luckily there are a categoty of tools called Version Control tools, that allows you to manage 
the files that you create and change everyday as a software developer. 
It allows you to manage your own files, but also to share your files and changes to your files with your 
collegues and even other people on the internet.

code on ```http://github.com```. You will get to know git and github well in the next few months.
